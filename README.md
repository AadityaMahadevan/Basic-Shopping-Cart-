This is a basic shopping cart application, built in Python, which asks the user their budget and alerts them if the limit has been exceeded,
as they add items to the cart with item name, quantity and cost. If the user wants to change the quantity, they can just add
the same item with the name , new quantity and cost per item which will get updated into the cart.
